Myrmidon is a framework for Python that aims to provide rapid development of 2D games via the use of Python generators for entities.

Using a simple and easy to use API, Myrmidon allows developers to create interactive games and was designed to be perfectly suited for prototypes, proof-of-concepts and game jams.

Myrmidon's bottom-line is that the developer should only be concerned about the behaviour of game objects and how the user interacts with them. Any low-level graphics, window or input handling should be the sole responsibility of Myrmidon. Hiding that as much as possible and allowing you to get on writing your game.

It has a modular system for engine backends, so although it may have certain dependencies, they are not set in stone.
